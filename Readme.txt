The project is using the UFC dataset from the provided dataset and explore the data and determine the features that make the UFC fighter success.
As an example, we will take a closer look into the case of Anderson Silva which is considered GOAT of UFC fighters.

First we do some EDA with the data such as looking for missing values, determine which columns we should use in the matches.csv file.

The result can be seen in the UFC_EDA.ipynb file.
